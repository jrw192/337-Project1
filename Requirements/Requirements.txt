For manula installation (not using the command prompt):

	Since we don't know what OS system you are running on, we can't provide you with direct files for manually downloading

Here is the link for the numPy download: https://pypi.org/project/numpy/#files
Here is the link for the imdbPY download: https://pypi.org/project/IMDbPY/#files
