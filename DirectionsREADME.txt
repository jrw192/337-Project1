Add the file to to the data folder and save it in the format "ggYEAR.json", (where the "YEAR" is the year of the awards) and then run main of the file in the command prompt.
So you would run "py main.py" etc. in the command prompt of in the path of our repository and then main will prompt you to give a year so input the year you put in "YEAR" for the filename.
If you want to run the gg_api file in the command prompt for our repository you would run "py gg_api.py" and it will prompt you to give a year so input the year you put in "YEAR" for the filename.
